# Coding challenge

Create a [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) app. It should be able to do the following thing:

- Start and stop a 25 minute countdown timer

**Note 1:** We do not expect you to create a stunning visual design by yourself, this is a development role. All power to you if you can though!

**Note 2:** We do not expect this to be perfect. It's okay if your solution has bugs or only works on the happy path right after the app loaded for the first time.

**In the app's bright future it should be possible to extend it with the following things:**

- Let the user set a timer duration
- Alternate between 3 different durations according to the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique): a stretch of focused work followed by a short break, and a long break after every four work stretches
- Let the user name or tag their tasks for which they set a timer (e.g. "write blog post") and display them in a list, along with their duration
